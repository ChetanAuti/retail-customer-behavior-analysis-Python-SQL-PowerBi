🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and preprocessing were performed using Python.
Steps Performed:
•	Data Loading: Imported dataset using pandas

•	Missing Value Handling: Imputed missing review ratings
•	Column Standardization: Renamed columns to snake_case
•	Feature Engineering:
o	Created age_group using age binning
o	Created purchase_frequency_days
•	Redundancy Check: Removed promo_code_used after verifying overlap with discount_applied
•	Database Integration: Loaded cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL for SQL analysis
